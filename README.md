# Instagram-User-Analytics
The project is a data analysis of a social media platform just like Instagram. People can upload content ranging fromm text to picture, videos, GIF's also. In this project.
I'm using SQL and MySQL Workbench as my tool to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. 
My insights will help the manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app.
The goal of this project is to upscale and improve my SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data.
